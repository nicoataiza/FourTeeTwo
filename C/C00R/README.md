Rush 00 Files
# TO-DO: Changing the characters in the rush functions
# 	 basically creates the other Rush0X files
# TO-DO: Check for edge cases (?)
# TO-DO: Check norminette (LOL)

To compile the code make sure all the files are in the same directory.
Run the following command:

cc main.c ft_putchar.c rush00.c -Wall -Werror -Wextra

You can change the input by editing main.c
Sample input:
x = 5, y = 3

Output (in terminal):

$ ./a.out
o---o
|   |
|   |
o---o
$
